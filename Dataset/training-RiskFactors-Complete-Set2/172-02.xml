Dear Dr. Ito,

Ida was seen back today for evaluation of Sjogren's as well as left wrist 
pain.  Her Sjogren's has been reasonably stable.  She still remains with 
difficulty in controlling her blood sugar.  She has continued difficulty with 
her oral cavity.  She has had no extraglandular symptoms -- specifically, 
polyneuropathy, myopathy, or purpura.

She uses artificial tears and saliva.  She remains on insulin and estrogens.

She has a one-week history of pain and swelling of her left wrist.  She was 
seen at the Graduate Hospital Emergency Room several days ago.  Radiographs of the 
wrist show chondrocalcinosis.  She was started on Motrin with some response 
but still has active symptoms.  She is wearing a splint.

Today on exam, she is afebrile.  There was OA involving the DIP joints.  PIPs 
and MCPs were nontender.  The left wrist showed swelling and heat with 
diminished motion.  Right wrist showed full range of motion.  Elbows, 
shoulders, hips, knees, ankles, and feet did not show active synovitis.  
There was no adenopathy and lungs were clear.

I aspirated the left wrist under sterile technique.  No fluid was obtained.  
I injected it with 40 mg of Depo-Medrol.

Clinically, I think she has had pseudogout.  She has chondrocalcinosis on 
radiograph and has a clinical picture consistent with crystal disease.  In 
addition, she has primary Sjogren's.  The two diseases are unrelated.

In addition to injection of her wrist, I switched her from Motrin to Celebrex 
200 mg twice a day due to side effect profile issues.  She should probably 
take that for about five to seven days.  Side effects were reviewed.

I would like to see her back in four months.  She will be returning to you 
for further care in the interim.

ADDENDUM:  At her next visit, I will want her to check her calcium and 
thyroid status since that can be associated with CPPD disease.

With best wishes,

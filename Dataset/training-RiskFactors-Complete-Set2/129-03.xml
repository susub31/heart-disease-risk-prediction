Patient Name: FALLON, SHARON;  MRN: 1703242
Dictated on: 11/11/2074 by PATRICIA DRAKE, N.P., PH.D. 

 
HISTORY:  Mrs. Fallon returns to clinic for evaluation and management of a right posterior ankle ulceration.  Since her last visit to the clinic, she was evaluated by Dr. Frederick Archer who admitted her for a diagnostic angiogram, which revealed that she had adequate perfusion to the ankle level 
to heal the ulceration.  
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination, Mrs. Fallon has ruborous discoloration of the distal half of her bilateral lower extremity with scattered vesicles on the anterior surface of her left lower extremity.  The 
ulceration is on the posterior aspect of the right ankle.  It measured 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm.  The tissue is moist yellow subcutaneous tissue, the margin is clear.  In the setting of ruborous discoloration, it appears that Mrs. Fallon may have an acute flare of her chronic lipodermatosclerosis.   
PLAN:  Daily wound care per the following protocol; 1.  Normal saline irrigation 30 cc x 3.  A thin layer of 50% Diprolene ointment 0.05% with Bactroban cream to the wound bed and the wide periwound margin.  Primary dressing will be Telfa covered with rolled gauze.  Mrs. Fallon will return to clinic in 2 weeks unless the wound bed is closed and then she will follow up with Dr. Archer on Tuesday, November 26th.

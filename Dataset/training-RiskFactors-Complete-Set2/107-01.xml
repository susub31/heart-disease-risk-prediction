The patient was seen in conjunction with resident, Dr. Anderson.

 PA's note was reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined by

me.  Please see the PA's note for details of the patient's past

medical, social, family history, review of systems, and physical

exam.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Rash on legs.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 79-year-old man brought in by his

family complaining of a pruritic rash on his bilateral ankles and

today, both ankles are slightly more swollen than usual.  He has

no difficulty breathing, no chest pain.  The patient used to live

in England 4 days ago, arrived in Frankenmuth to live now

permanently with his family here.  He has a history of "heart

problems for which he is taking Lasix, enalapril, and amlodipine

and is compliant with these medications.  He says initially his

legs were not swollen.  It was only today that the family

happened to notice as he was complaining of a rash that he had

slightly increased swelling of these ankles bilaterally.  The

patient's daughter reports that she bought him new long underwear

and noticed that the rash began where the underwear elastic band

hit his ankles in that similar distribution, there is pruritus

with evidence of excoriation.  He also does have evidence of

chronic venous stasis changes in his legs.  The leg swelling is

equal bilaterally does not extend to the calf and is minimal. 

The patient reports that he coughs when he is out in the cold

Frankenmuth air, but does not produce any sputum.  Has baseline

orthopnea and PND of 3 pillows which has not changed.  He has had

no worsening shortness of breath and no chest pain.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for hypertension, TIA.  He has

no history of DVT.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  No significant surgical procedures.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a past smoker, does not drink or use

drugs.  Lives with his family.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise, negative.

ALLERGIES:  Has no allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, in no distress,

afebrile.  Normal and stable vital signs, saturating 96-97% on

room air.  His exam is unremarkable except for excoriation to the

bilateral ankles with chronic venous stasis changes bilaterally

and trace 1-2+ edema bilaterally equal and the ankles only down

to the mid foot.  He has strong and equal, 2+ dorsalis pedis

pulses in the feet.  The rest of his examination is unremarkable

with clear lungs and breath sounds.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient said has no plans to

get a doctor in America.  He filled out an application

for Frankenmuth Care on arrival to the Emergency Department.  I spoke

with him and his family at length about the need to immediately

get a primary care doctor.  He was given the numbers for the

Tobey Hospital and Heritage Residence.  He has about 3 weeks of his

medications left and he is told that he will need to see ____. 

The family understands the urgency of this situation.

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Today is dermatitis.  He is told to continue

his medications as prescribed to elevate the feet to decrease the

swelling.

DISPOSITION:  Discharged in satisfactory condition to follow up

with the primary care physician.

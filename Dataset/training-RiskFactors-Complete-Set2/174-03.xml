RE: Lloyd Gregg 

    MR#65772757

 

Dear Xzavior, 

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Lloyd Gregg for follow

up of his emphysema.

 

The patient reports that he continues to lead a very

active lifestyle working as a sales representative roughly 10 hours

a day, frequently lifting 60 pound boxes.  When he

returns home from work he cooks dinner and this

combined with his work schedule and picking up his

daughter from school and walking the dog has prohibited

him from a regular exercise program.  Needless to say,

he has remained active.  He is not limited in these

activities by his respiratory function with the

exception of some periodic exacerbation of dyspnea with

heavy lifting.  He uses albuterol during these

instances anywhere between 0 and 2 to 3 times per day. 

His usual peak expiratory flow rate is roughly 300-350

liters per minute.  He knows that when his PEFR falls

to below 250 for 3 days in a row to contact you for

advice as well as burst of prednisone and he has had 1

burst of prednisone since our last visit in April.

 

His medical regimen is notable for Flovent 220

micrograms per puffs, 2 puffs twice a day, Serevent MDI

2 puffs twice a day, Allopurinol, colchicine, Vasotec

and the albuterol as mentioned above.

The patient's review of systems is notable for the absence of

fevers, chills, sweats, chest discomfort, symptoms of GERD,

change in his bowel or bladder habits or weight.  He does

continue to have nearly continuous post nasal drip which leads to

frequent clearing of his throat and occasional cough.  There is

no hemoptysis or significant sputum production.

 

On physical exam, he appears well, is in no respiratory distress. 

NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI, AS, pink conjunctiva.  TM's are clear with

normal light reflexes bilaterally.  His nasal mucosa is notable

for mild erythema bilaterally with a clear nasal discharge.  No

significant LAN in the cervical or supraclavicular axillary

chains.  Chest exam reveals an increased AP diameter and

prolongation of his expiratory phase.  He has an occasional

expiratory wheeze.  There are no focal findings of consolidation

and air movement is moderate.  No significant JVD and he has a

regular rate and rhythm with an S4, S1, a normally split S2 and

there are no murmurs, rubs or S3.  Abdomen is benign without HSM,

focal tenderness or masses.  His extremities are without

clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  His weight is 223 pounds. 

Temperature 97.1 degrees, pulse 86 per minute, BP 142/82 and his

respiratory rate is 20 with a room air resting oxygen saturation

of 97 percent.

 

My impression is that the patient's severe airflow obstruction

secondary to emphysema is stable on his current medical regimen. 

I once again encouraged him to continue to lead robust and active

life.  We agreed that the current action plan for a burst of

prednisone is appropriate and I also have provided him my contact

information in the event that he cannot reach you in the midst of

a flare.  I have refilled all of his current prescriptions.  To

try and prevent him from requiring these frequent bursts of

prednisone through the winter months, we have also begun

Combivent 2 puffs 4 times a day as well as Nasonex nasal spray to

be used 2 puffs in each nostril once a day.  We talked about

vaccinations and he reported that he has recently received the

influenza vaccine and he has previously received the pneumonia

vaccine.

 

Thank you for allowing me to participate in Mr. Gregg's care. 

He will follow up with us on a routine basis in 6 month's time

but will contact us sooner should he develop more symptoms of a

flare of his COPD.
